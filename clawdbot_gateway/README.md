# OpenClaw Gateway

Run [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) on Home Assistant OS with secure SSH tunnel access.

## Features

- 🦞 **OpenClaw Gateway** — AI agent with messaging, automation, and more
- 🔒 **SSH Tunnel** — Secure remote access for the OpenClaw app or CLI
- 📦 **Persistent Storage** — All data survives add-on updates
- 🛠️ **Included Tools** — gog (Google Workspace), gh (GitHub), hass-cli

## Quick Start

1. Add this repository to Home Assistant
2. Install "OpenClaw Gateway" from the Add-on Store
3. Configure your SSH public key in the add-on options
4. Start the add-on and connect via SSH tunnel

After connecting, run `openclaw configure` to finish setup (including gateway mode and auth token).

By default the add-on uses preinstalled OpenClaw package mode (`install_mode=package`) to avoid source builds on low-memory devices.
